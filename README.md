# Automation Pivot

Automation Pivot is a WooCommerce-first Streamlit business intelligence workspace for e-commerce sales, customer intelligence, inventory visibility, live stream monitoring, and operational diagnostics.

The current app is organized around five primary workspaces:

- `Business Intelligence`: executive KPIs, sales analysis, customer behavior, inventory, forecasts, and data-audit views
- `Stream Monitor`: live stream sales visibility from the locked stream sheet
- `Customer Intelligence`: lifetime customer metrics, RFM segmentation, and retention context
- `Commerce Hub`: WooCommerce order sync, inventory fetch, previews, and local storage utilities
- `System Health`: logs, diagnostics, and operational trust tools

## Product Direction

This codebase now follows a few key principles:

- WooCommerce is the primary operational source for orders, customers, and inventory
- local cache is treated as a first-class runtime layer for speed
- long-running refresh work happens in the background whenever possible
- customer lifecycle metrics use full available WooCommerce history, not just the visible date range
- UI components and date handling are shared across pages for a more homogeneous product feel

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Date Defaults

Across the app, date selectors are standardized to:

- start date: `2022-08-01`
- end date: latest available day (`today`)

## Core Architecture

### Frontend

- [app.py](H:/Analysis/Automation-Pivot/app.py): thin application shell, sidebar controls, page registry rendering
- [FrontEnd/pages/__init__.py](H:/Analysis/Automation-Pivot/FrontEnd/pages/__init__.py): primary page registry and page metadata
- [FrontEnd/components/ui_components.py](H:/Analysis/Automation-Pivot/FrontEnd/components/ui_components.py): shared design system, highlight cards, commentary blocks, and loaded-date context helpers

### Backend

- [BackEnd/services/hybrid_data_loader.py](H:/Analysis/Automation-Pivot/BackEnd/services/hybrid_data_loader.py): hybrid loading, local cache management, background refresh jobs, full-history sync status
- [BackEnd/services/woocommerce_service.py](H:/Analysis/Automation-Pivot/BackEnd/services/woocommerce_service.py): WooCommerce API access for orders and stock
- [BackEnd/services/customer_insights.py](H:/Analysis/Automation-Pivot/BackEnd/services/customer_insights.py): customer normalization, lifetime metrics, RFM segmentation, and first-order logic
- [BackEnd/services/ml_insights.py](H:/Analysis/Automation-Pivot/BackEnd/services/ml_insights.py): demand forecast, churn-risk scoring, anomaly detection
- [BackEnd/utils/sales_schema.py](H:/Analysis/Automation-Pivot/BackEnd/utils/sales_schema.py): canonical sales schema normalization

## Data Strategy

The app uses a hybrid local-first strategy:

1. historical local data is loaded from parquet
2. WooCommerce order and stock cache is read first for fast UI response
3. stale or missing WooCommerce cache is refreshed in the background
4. lifetime WooCommerce history can be built through a one-time full sync
5. live stream views use the locked Google Sheet sources for stream-only reporting

## Customer and Revenue Counting

### Revenue

- dashboard and BI revenue uses one `order_total` per distinct `order_id`
- this avoids double-counting multi-item orders in flattened line-item datasets
- product analysis uses estimated line revenue instead of repeated full-order totals

### Customers

- `Unique Customers` means distinct normalized customers inside the visible filter
- `New Customers` means customers whose first-ever WooCommerce order falls inside the relevant period
- lifetime customer metrics use full available WooCommerce history from local cache plus stored historical Woo data

## Working with the Codebase

Recommended areas for future work:

- add more small helpers in `FrontEnd/components/ui_components.py` before duplicating UI markup in pages
- keep page-specific rendering in `FrontEnd/pages/`
- keep data retrieval, cache management, and model logic in `BackEnd/services/`
- keep schema normalization and cross-source cleanup in `BackEnd/utils/`
- prefer extending the page registry in `FrontEnd/pages/__init__.py` instead of wiring page tabs directly in `app.py`

## Legacy / Archived Areas

Some older modules still exist in the repository for backward reference or recovery work, including AI assistant and older operational tools. They are not part of the current primary navigation and should be treated as secondary unless explicitly reintroduced.

## Verification

Typical local verification commands:

```bash
python -m py_compile app.py FrontEnd\pages\dashboard.py FrontEnd\pages\customer_insights.py FrontEnd\pages\live_stream.py FrontEnd\pages\woocommerce.py
python -m unittest tests.test_hybrid_data_loader tests.test_customer_history tests.test_dashboard_revenue
```
