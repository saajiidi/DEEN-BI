# Automation Pivot Architecture

This document describes the current application architecture after the WooCommerce-first BI refactor.

## 1. Application Shape

Automation Pivot is now structured as a local-first analytics app with a thin Streamlit shell and a service-oriented backend.

### Primary navigation

- `Business Intelligence`
- `Customer Intelligence`
- `Commerce Hub`
- `System Health`

These primary workspaces are registered centrally in:

- `FrontEnd/utils/config.py`
- `FrontEnd/pages/__init__.py`

That registry-based approach keeps `app.py` small and makes future navigation changes predictable.

## 2. Frontend Layers

### App shell

- `app.py`

Responsibilities:

- page config
- numbered dataframes
- sidebar controls
- page registry rendering
- bootstrap-level error handling

### Pages

- `FrontEnd/pages/dashboard.py`
- `FrontEnd/pages/customer_insights.py`
- `FrontEnd/pages/woocommerce.py`
- `FrontEnd/pages/system_health.py`

Responsibilities:

- page-specific user flow
- feature composition
- page-level charts, commentary, and previews

### Shared components

- `FrontEnd/components/ui_components.py`

Responsibilities:

- design system styles
- hero sections
- commentary cards
- audit cards
- highlight stats
- loaded-date context display
- export helpers

## 3. Backend Layers

### Core services

- `BackEnd/services/hybrid_data_loader.py`
- `BackEnd/services/woocommerce_service.py`
- `BackEnd/services/customer_insights.py`
- `BackEnd/services/ml_insights.py`

Responsibilities:

- WooCommerce sales dataset loading
- WooCommerce API access
- local cache persistence
- background refresh scheduling
- full WooCommerce history sync
- customer-lifecycle metrics
- forecasting and anomaly signals

### Utilities

- `BackEnd/utils/sales_schema.py`

Responsibilities:

- canonical column mapping
- normalized identifiers
- schema cleanup across WooCommerce order and inventory exports

## 4. Data Flow

### Sales and customer flow

1. load WooCommerce cache if available
2. show cache-backed UI immediately
3. trigger background refresh if stale or incomplete
4. recompute customer and BI views from normalized data
5. use lifetime WooCommerce history for first-order and retention logic

### Inventory flow

1. fetch stock from WooCommerce REST API
2. cache local stock snapshot
3. reuse cached inventory while refresh runs
4. compare stock against demand forecast

## 5. Trust and Consistency Rules

The current app emphasizes user trust through a few shared rules:

- date selectors default to `2022-08-01` through `today`
- pages show requested date range and actual loaded activity range
- revenue in BI and KPI views is counted once per order
- unique customers are filter-based
- new customers are lifetime-history based
- WooCommerce history sync runs in the background and does not block the UI

## 6. Future Development Guidance

When adding features:

- put UI composition in `FrontEnd/pages/`
- put reusable display logic in `FrontEnd/components/ui_components.py`
- put cache, loading, sync, and analytical logic in `BackEnd/services/`
- reuse the page registry rather than wiring tabs directly in `app.py`
- prefer extending canonical schema logic before adding page-local column hacks

## 7. Legacy Code

The repository still contains older modules and historical structures under `src/` and some non-primary frontend pages. These remain useful as reference material, but the active product path is the registry-driven Streamlit app described above.
